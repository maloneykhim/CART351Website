            <h2 class="project__question">By Maloney Khim and Hannah Kim</h2>

            <br><br>
            <h3 class="project__question">Name of our project</h3>

            <p class="project__information">Meme Multiverse (Placeholder Name)</p>

            <br><br>
            <h3 class="project__question">What is your starting topic? What importance does it hold for you? For others? 
            Why is it important to make this topic into an explorable networked space?</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="project__information">For our project, we have chosen the topic of memes, since it is a phenomenon that is often associated with people our age. Indeed, Gen Z individuals (born in the late 90s and the early 2000s) have grown up alongside the rapid proliferation of the internet. Nowadays, they have efficiently incorporated social media platforms and instant messaging into their everyday tasks. Memes are one of the defining features of Gen Z’s online culture. They exemplify how Gen Z has harnessed the internet's capabilities to redefine how we communicate and share ideas in the 21st century. 
                In a way, memes are kind of like inside jokes between friends. As they get spread from user to user, they slowly start to change, like in the telephone game. Like meteors in the virtual night sky, they often captivate our attention for a moment before fading into obscurity, only to be replaced by a new one. Their fleetingness makes them more appealing, as it keeps online communities constantly on the lookout for the next viral sensation.
                These comical, and often satirical creations have become something akin to a universal language for netizens. They exist in many different forms, whether they be text, image or video. They can be created by anyone and can be about absolutely anything. Furthermore, memes do not exist as isolated entities, they are part of a large network. We want to make this topic into an explorable networked platform because it is a good representation of how our values and concepts evolve through time.
            </p>
                <br>
            <h3 class="project__question">Think about the kind of relationship you wish to encourage between your users and this space. 
                How can you use this space to destabilize the users and make them reflect on themselves, their environment and society?</h3>
                <br>
            <p class="project__information">We want to create an explorable networked space that not only entertains the user but also encourages them to reflect on the participative aspect of memes as well as their sociocultural background. To do so, we plan to emphasize the diverse nature of memes. Their subject could go from silly pop culture references to serious social commentary, reflecting various perspectives and worldviews.
                The users will realize that memes often reflect current social trends, encapsulating the collective humour, anxieties, and cultural references of the moment. Their ephemeral nature mirrors the fast-paced, ever-evolving landscape of internet culture, where trends can rise and fall in the blink of an eye. We also want to incorporate memes that challenge stereotypes, biases, or preconceived notions. We will use the space to showcase how memes can be a tool for positive social change, highlighting instances where memes have raised awareness or advocated for important causes.
                From a broader perspective, one could also state that the entirety of humanity’s ideals, philosophy, art and culture has been passed along and modified like an internet meme. We believe memes would work well as a theme because they demonstrate how information and culture flow across the internet, illustrating the power of connectivity. Our networked space will allow the user to add their own creation to what is essentially a patchwork quilt of memes. Our project will foster engagement by allowing them to not only consume memes but also to create and share their own from a prompt. This will create a sense of ownership and investment in the space.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="project__question">Think about the notion of empowerment. Will your "space" help, challenge, teach, enable collaboration, 
            understanding between user(s)? How and Why?</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="project__information">Our envisioned network space is designed to empower users in several ways. First, by letting them share their own meme, they will not only be empowered to express themselves but also to interact with other people. This way, they can contribute to the ever-evolving field of crowdsourced works. By studying memes in an organized space, users can gain a deeper understanding of how collaborative works can instil a feeling of agency and belonging.
                In addition to that, by looking at other participants’ creations, the users will be able to reflect on their sociocultural context and notice how diverse memes and by extension the Earth’s population is. They will analyze the similarities and differences between the multiple submissions and have a better understanding of how it affects their view of the world as well as their relationships with other people. This space will help foster critical thinking and a deeper understanding of societal issues and cultural references.
                Furthermore, this networked space illustrates the connectivity inherent in meme culture, highlighting how they are a means through which humans communicate ideas and relate to one another. It shows how memes can be harnessed as tools for raising awareness of important causes and advocating for positive social change. Finally, while memes often have a short lifespan, their overall effect on society can last much longer. The temporary nature of memes serves as a poignant reminder that even small, creative contributions can leave a lasting imprint on our cultural and social fabric.

            <h3 class="project__question">1st Similar Project</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="project__information">
                https://studiomoniker.com/projects/do-not-touch <br> <br>
                "Do Not Touch" is an interactive and crowd-sourced music video created for the song "Kilo" by the band Light Light. The project serves as a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the computer pointer, which has been an integral part of the user-computer interface for decades. As modern technology shifts towards multi-touch interfaces, the traditional computer pointer is gradually becoming obsolete, making it an interesting focal point for this interactive video.
                The interactive experience begins with a straightforward message informing viewers that their pointers are being recorded. Participants are engaged through a series of questions and tasks, such as identifying their geographical location and capturing a green dot with their enlarged cursor as they navigate an old computer screen with large pixels. In the background, many pointers from previous participants form a sea of moving arrows. Some users follow the prescribed path, while others diverge, creating a dynamic and diverse visual narrative.
                The video turns unexpectedly as the camera zooms out, revealing the physical space where the band Light is performing. Viewers are presented with entertaining challenges and questions based on the objects and activities in the band's environment. Tasks range from "Form a mask" to "Play the bass," all while adhering to the playful directive of "Do not touch the model."
                "Do Not Touch" is a creative exploration of the evolving relationship between users and technology, inviting viewers to engage with the familiar computer pointer in a new and interactive way. It combines elements of nostalgia, user participation, and artistic expression to deliver a unique and engaging music video experience that reflects the evolution of human-computer interaction over the past half-century.

            <h3 class="project__question">2nd Similar Project</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="project__information">
                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poietic_Generator <br> <br>
                The Poietic Generator, conceived by Olivier Auber in 1986 and developed in 1987 under the free art label with the contributions of many individuals, is a unique social-network game. This game unfolds within a two-dimensional matrix, reminiscent of traditional board games, and draws inspiration from Conway's Game of Life and the surrealist technique, exquisite corpse.
                However, the Poietic Generator distinguishes itself from these models in several fundamental ways. Unlike Conway's algorithmic approach, it relies on human players who, in real-time, control the graphic elements within a global matrix, with each person representing one unit. In contrast to the exquisite corpse, where parts of the creation remain hidden, here, all players' actions are fully visible to one another throughout the game. Unlike conventional board games, the Poietic Generator lacks the traditional concept of winning or losing. Instead, its primary objective is the collective creation of recognizable forms, providing an opportunity to observe how people collaboratively bring these forms to life.
                The name "Poietic Generator" derives its inspiration from the concept of autopoiesis in life sciences (as introduced by Francisco Varela) and the philosophical notion of the poietic in the realm of art (as discussed by Paul Valéry and René Passeron). This name aptly illustrates the process of self-organization that underpins the continuous emergence of the overall image within the game. From its inception, the Poietic Generator has been part of a broader action research endeavor aimed at fostering an "Art of Speed."
                In summary, the Poietic Generator represents a novel and collaborative approach to creativity and self-expression, transcending traditional gaming paradigms to explore the realms of shared artistic creation and continuous self-organization.

            <h3 class="project__question">What makes our project different?</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="project__information">After conducting thorough research and exploring many different projects/ideas, we were drawn to the concept of crowd-sourcing as an exciting idea to foster a community of users. Our aim is to provide individuals with a platform to express their thoughts and ideas using one of today’s forms of communication: memes.
                For this project, users should be part of the curation rather than a spectator, and this was inspired by a quote by Ramona Austin, curator of the Baron and Ellin Gordon Art Galleries at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va. She quotes, “If we open the public to the nature of the creative process and allow them opportunities to experience it, a great humanistic service will have been done.” 
                This generation has a prevalent tendency to conceal our thoughts and genuine feelings behind humour. Memes are a universal language that our generation can all understand. Whether used for humour, critique or used for personal thoughts, memes resonate with our generation on a profound level. While other project's final outcome results in an oversized canvas such as drawing. Our approach is based more on building a community rather than final artwork. We value individuality and want to offer the creative freedom for users to be able to create their own memes. We recognize the dynamic nature of memes and their potential to foster deeper connections and mutual understandings among our audience. Our project aims to be inclusive, engaging, and universally relatable, creating a unique environment where users can interact and connect with one another. This sets our project apart from others we’ve researched or encountered.
